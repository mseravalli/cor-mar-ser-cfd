Assignment 1

to compile the file simply run (the object files are placed in the obj folder)
$ make

to run the file simply type
$./sim
the vtk files will be stored in the files/ folder

in order not to write the vtk files 0 could be passed as parameter
$./sim 0

this speeds up the code significantly
